# Small Spotify Widget
this is just a thing i made for fun as a starter project, its like my second javascript thing ever

you will need your own client and access keys from spotify's developer page at https://developer.spotify.com/

it is developed with vite, to test it run 'npm run dev', and to build it run 'npm run build'.
